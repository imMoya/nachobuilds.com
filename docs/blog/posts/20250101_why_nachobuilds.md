# Why nachobuilds?
The simple idea: my name is Nacho and this year I'm commited to build

Building can be seen as a verb that denotes action and collaboration. These two concepts have been identified as some of the key areas where to focus in order to create momentum for personal projects.

### Background
Although I'm not a Computer Science graduate, I have some exposure to the industry. As an student of Aerospace Engineering, I started to learn Python back in 2018 when I needed to plot some graphs for my final year dissertation. This was something which enabled me to continue using coding as a tool for my university projects and for my day-to-day work. Working in an Aerodynamics Department, the need for treating data and postprocessing simulations is a must, and I felt Python was a tool I could use for making my work more automated and to exploit the data. 

During COVID, as the market possibilities for the Aerospace Industry were few and the tech industry was booming, I decided to take a course on Data Engineering.
